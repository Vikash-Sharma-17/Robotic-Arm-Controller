# Real-Time Gesture Control for Robotic Hands

This project implements a real-time gesture-based control system for robotic hands using advanced computer vision techniques and deep learning models. The system enables intuitive, touchless control of robotic hands by recognizing human gestures through a camera feed, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for accurate and responsive performance.

Developed as part of a Bachelor of Engineering final year project at Chandigarh University, this work addresses limitations of traditional control methods—such as joysticks and sensor gloves—by offering a contactless, adaptive, and scalable solution suitable for applications in healthcare, industrial automation, and rehabilitation.

Key highlights:

Real-time gesture recognition using CNNs

High precision and low-latency control

Robust performance across varying environments

Modular architecture for future scalability
